# pytorch and tensorflow basics(linear regression and MNIST image classification)

PyTorch vs TensorFlow: This repository provides  code for new deep learning researchers to compare PyTorch and tensorflow. 
Whatâ€™s the difference? Both are open source Python libraries that use graphs to perform numerical computation on data.
Which library to use depends on your own style and preference, your data and model, and your project goal.
## Pre- requests:
- python
- numpy
- tensorflow
- pytorch



```bash
pip install tensorflow
pip install torch
pip install torchvision
```


## Usage
A set of examples around pytorch and tensorflow.run each file python files.
```

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
